# electron-with-express

This is an Electron starter project that serves it's content from Next.js with a custom Express server. In addition to that a Socket.IO server is set up to allow
for communication between the front end and backend.

## Status

This is a work in progress and not all functionality has been added. The Electron bits are not wired up yet.
